# JS Challenger Solution

### Variable
<hr/>

### 1. Reassign a value to a variable
- Assign a new value to the variable num. The code will not work the way it is. Find the mistake and fix it. Execute the corrected code.

```javascript
let num = 1;
num = 2;
console.log(num);
```

### 2. Assign a value to a variable
- Here, we declare the variable num. But, it has no value yet. Assign a value to it and run the code.
```javascript
let num;
num = 1;
console.log(num);
```

### 3. Assign the value of another variable
- Here, we have two variables numOne and numTwo. numOne already has a value. Assign numTwo the value of numOne and run the code.

```javascript
let numOne;
let numTwo = numOne;
console.log(numTwo);
```
### 4. Create the missing variable
- Below, we attempt to assign the value of a variable named numOne to the variable numTwo. But, that variable has not been declared yet. Declare a variable named numOne and run the code.

```javascript
let numOne = 5;
let numTwo = numOne;
console.log(numTwo);
```
### 5. Accessing a variable (1)
- In this simple exercise we declare a variable called num and assign it a value of 5. Then we try to log the value of the variable using the console.log() method.
But, the console.log() method contains a small mistake. If you try to run the code, you will see an error message.
Fix the mistake and run the code again.
```javascript
const num = 5;
console.log(num);
```
### 6. Accessing a variable (2)
- This exercise is very similar to the previous one. We declare a variable called num, assign it a value of 5, and try to log it. But again, we introduced a small mistake.
Fix the code and run it.
```javascript
const num = 5;
console.log(num);
```
### 7. Declare a variable and assign a number

- In this exercise we practice how to declare a new variable and how to assign it a number. The console.log() statement below attempts to log a variable named num.
Declare a variable with this name and assign it a number of your choice. Run the code to see if the number is being logged.
```javascript
const num = 5;
console.log('The value of num is: ' + num);
```
### 8. Reassign a value to a variable (2)

- The code below first declares a variable named num with a string value hello. Then, a new value bye is assigned. Finally, the variable is logged.
But, the code will not work like that. Find the mistake and fix it. Execute the corrected code.
```javascript
let num = 1;
num = 2;
console.log(num);
```
<hr/>

### Booleans
<hr/>

### 1. Assign boolean to a variable

- Here, we declare the variable isTrue. But, it has no value yet. Assign a boolean value to it and run the code.

```javascript
const num = 5;
console.log(num);
```
