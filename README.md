# JS Challenger Solution

## Variable

### 1. Reassign a value to a variable
- Assign a new value to the variable num. The code will not work the way it is. Find the mistake and fix it. Execute the corrected code.

```javascript
let num = 1;
num = 2;
console.log(num);
```

### 2. Assign a value to a variable
- Here, we declare the variable num. But, it has no value yet. Assign a value to it and run the code.
```javascript
let num;
num = 1;
console.log(num);
```

### 3. Assign the value of another variable
- Here, we have two variables numOne and numTwo. numOne already has a value. Assign numTwo the value of numOne and run the code.

```javascript
let numOne;
let numTwo = numOne;
console.log(numTwo);
```
